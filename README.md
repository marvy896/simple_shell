PROJECT DETAILS

Welcome to Marveni Simple Shell Project. This program is a simple shell and can be compiled on the command line.

HOW TO COMPILE
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

BRIEF SYNOPSIS
The contents of this repository are intended to be compiled with the GNU Compiler Collection 'gcc' in a Linux environment running 'Ubuntu 20.04 LTS'. Upon compilation, the resulting executable file emulates a command line interpreter, commonly known as a 'shell', which provides users with access to the services offered by an operating system. This particular shell includes a range of custom built-in commands, and is also compatible with other commands located in the system's PATH. The commands are designed to produce output and offer functionality that is similar to the 'sh' (dash) and some 'bash' commands.

COMMANDS
This shell supports a variety of commands:
alias - create or list an alias
cd - change directory
env - list the current environment variables
exit - exit the shell
